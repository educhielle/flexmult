This is a simplified version of a flexible modular
 multiplier emulator. This particular version is a
 basic example that uses small numbers (not utilizing
 big number arithmetic) and includes other
 simplifications. For more advanced emulators with
 different variations, options, or large-size
 arithmetic, please contact the MoMA lab, NYUAD.
